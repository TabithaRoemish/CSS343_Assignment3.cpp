	JollyFeedBack Issues: 1)In VS and Linux when I compile and read graph1 and graph 2 I get the correct number of vertices,
in JollyFeedBack, in graph1 and graph2 it says I'm counting one more vertex than there is. I don't know why this was happening. 
I reviewed my code, I'm only increasing vertex when I create a new one and everything else is working so I'm just going to submit as is. 
2) I got a performance warning from Jolly Feedback,
"Prefer prefix ++/-- operators for non-primitive types." I don't know what this means/don't know the alternative so
I hope this doesn't count against efficiency.
